# M1_Road_Traffic_Program -

The file includes three codes, a README, and a requirement.
Regarding the three codes:
The code "Progressively_filled_road.ipynb" deals with only one lane where cars come from the left of the road progressively
The code "Filled_road.ipynb" also treats only one lane but this time the cars appear directly on the road. 
Finally the last code "Overtacking_road.ipynb" highlights the overtaking of cars on two lanes.

When you compile the code, you can set different parameters like: speed of cars, acceleration, braking time, length of road. But also the parameters of the simulation : the simulation time, the time between two simulations. Then, the code compiles and opens a simulation pygame window. You can press the up arrow to make the simulation go faster, or the down arrow to make it go slower (in fact the recorded data appear more or less quickly depending on whether you press or not). Then if you close the simulation window a graph will be saved with the parameters you have set in a "Documents" folder (you can also change the name of this folder and the path)
